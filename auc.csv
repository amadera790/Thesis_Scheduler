CJ220|Fear, Crime, & Media|Revier, Kevin|"Fear is defined by psychologists as an ""intense emotion aroused by the detection of imminent threat.""  While deeply felt on an individual level, fear is also a culturally shared emotion.  Indeed, researchers have considered a ""culture of fear"" in which a sense of fear, insecurity and risk shapes everyday interaction.  It is perhaps no wonder, given mass media images of danger - of killer clowns, drug ""zombies"", cyber stalkers, kidnapping strangers, serial killers, and juvenile superpredators.  How is fear constructed in the media? What are the consequences of such representation - for community, consumerism, and criminal justice? In this course, we adopt theory in criminology and sociology to study the construction of fear in the media and consequences thereof.  We utilize various methods including media/visual analysis coupled with survey, interview, and ethnography.  As fear is embedded in representations of crime - and informs public concerns, entertainment, and punishment - analyzing fear is important for understanding contemporary social inequality and for broader social change."

Among the questions to be asked are: Why do people commit deviant and criminal acts? What acts are defined as deviant and criminal, and why? Who has the power to define acts as deviant and criminal? Students will be expected to understand the various theories and their implications, as well as to develop an understanding of their own theory of deviance and criminality.

ED720|Ethical Leadership in Educational Adm|Brasof, Marc|Educators today are faced with meeting the needs of students in an increasingly complex and diverse society.  Educational leaders are charged not only with promoting academic excellence for students within the context of standards-based reform initiatives, but also for making ethical decisions founded on moral principles.  There are no easy solutions to the ethical problems that educational leaders face on a daily basis.  The values and principles which guide ethical decision-making will be studied, with the objective of teaching students how to develop a process for examining those ethical issues.  Students will explore how to combine and/or adapt ideas stemming from foundational ethical theories as they face dilemmas and difficult decisions.  Students will analyze case studies through a multiple paradigm approach.  Through this process incorporating self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-critique, students will acquire the ability to analyze, respond, and assess their responses to ethical dilemmas, such as making policy decisions, maintaining communication with community members and district administrators, as well as dealing with staff and student relations.  Participants will gain an understanding of how to transfer their ethical self-awareness and knowledge to the educational leader's job of dealing with personnel, students, and community members in a fair and equitable manner with professional integrity.

US255|Grand Constructions:Stonehenge|McNulty, Mary Kate|This seminar will chronologically examine the development of architecture within the context of the social, cultural and religious influences that shaped its form and function. Beginning with the early examples of the Druids and Egyptians, with their monolithic and circle structures, to medieval castle fortifications to present day skyscrapers - art and architecture are meant to evoke an emotional response in the viewer and to reflect the importance of specific societal unification. By looking back through the lens of history we can begin to make comparisons between ancient architecture and its relevance to modern architecture.  We can trace the transformation of architecture from public space to private space and how even the concept of space has changed.  The rise and fall of empires, war, famine, and advances in technology are all reflected in the architecture of a civilization.  What does architecture say about us as a society and what, if any, are its limits?
US260|Eco Cinema & Climate Change|Deshpande, Shekhar|The coming century brings grave uncertainty about our lives on the planet.  Climate change may after our ways of life; our relationship to each other, and our collective future.  This course examines the process of climate change in documentary films, fiction films, and reports issued by various government and agencies around the world.  We will chart the end of the Anthropocene- man-made-climate through these sources to assess how we are representing the most crucial global issue of the moment.  Documentary films include: Darwin’s Nightmare (2004), An Inconvenient Truth (2006), Up the Yangtze (2007), Gasland (2010), Chasing Ice (2012), Before the Flood (2016), An Incovenient Sequal-Truth to Power (2017), and The Age of Consequences (2017).  Fiction films: The Day After Tomorrow (2004), The Last Winter (2006), Wall-E (2008), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Downsizing (2017), and Geostorm (2017).  We will examine scientific reports on impact of climate change on water availability and purity, air and pollution, radiation, mobility, etc.  Assignments include weekly class participation, evaluations of films, a research project on a specific aspect of climate change and visual project/statement representing the urgency of climate change.
US273|Visual Propaganda & Armed Conflict|McCreery, Allyson|Armed conflicts have occurred in the historical record for thousands of years and the use of propaganda to support such endeavors has occurred nearly as long. While the development of new weapon technology and combat tactics has evolved over centuries, the use of propaganda has been present to justify the conflict, recruit participants, raise national awareness, or to present images of war to the population. Some of these images have become the most iconic of our time. From the early photography used during the U.S. Civil War, propaganda posters of the World Wars, the televised images of Vietnam, to the images of today, the use of propaganda in armed conflict has impacted the way individuals perceive armed conflicts around the globe. In this class, students will explore the complex dynamics of conflict with a focus on evaluating the impact of propaganda. Utilizing primary and secondary sources, the students will gather information on the strategic use of propaganda and examine its psychological, artistic, and nationalistic elements.
US275|Scientific Ethics|Hoffman, John|This course will examine the different types of ethical systems as the foundation for decision making.  Topics will include consideration of contemporary value conflicts associated with the impact that science and technology have on society; such as stem cell technology, gene therapy, and drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Each topic will be critically examined from the scientific, ethical and legal viewpoints.  Assignments will incorporate readings, discussions, position papers and debates.
US285|Craft + Activism = Craftivism|Loeffler, Carole|Craft + Activism = Craftivism is a course utilizing art and craft materials (often fiber-based) to create “gentle” protests to a variety of injustices and issues in our world today. The projects for this course are inspired by books, articles, websites and a variety of social media accounts from around the world that have been written and published since 2001, the unofficial “beginning” of craftivism. Over the course of the semester, students will read several books and articles on the history and rise of craftivism. Students will create approximately 8 projects, including one self-designed and one larger collaborative class project. The main impetus for this class is to have students refine their artistic voice and find a way to put ideas out into the world using traditional art and craft techniques and processes.
US287|Short Story & Photography|Deshpande, Shekhar|This course will examine that relationship through a close reading of several short stories (by Julio Cortázar, Italo Calvino, John Updike, Raymond Carver, Cynthia Ozick, William Faulkner, Bing Xin, Dorris Dörrie, E. Annie Proulx and others). We will proceed with the thesis that the relationship between short story and photography arises out of one of the fundamental paradoxes of photography: photographs are borne as “moments in time,” but their survival depends on the irresistible and inevitable stories they generate. With that in mind, the course will include exercises in writing short stories as responses to existing and new photographs.
